# NodeList

This is a small web application I wrote to keep track all my VPS and dedicated servers. The codes may messy as it was using by myself only in last 3 years.

The codes are written in PHP and frontend with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The database is stored in CSV files with no MySQL or SQLite extension needed.

I just added a `setup.php` so everyone can try to install and run it.

I will continue update the application if needed.
